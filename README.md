## Demos

1. [**Map Description and Live Regions**](demos/description-region.html)
   - Provide context to when the map has loaded and include a description when the map is in focus to further WCAG's [1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html) Success Criterion.
2. [**Consistent Focus**](demos/consistent-focus.html)
   - Provide a consistent focus order throughout your UI supporting WCAG's [2.4.3: Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-order.html) and [3.2.3: Consistent Navigation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-navigation.html) Success Criterion.
3. [**High Contrast**](demos/high-contrast.html)
   - Explore contrast with your data, altering the basemap and layer effects to support the map's purpose when a user has enabled high contrast on their operating system, also supporting WCAG's [1.4.3: Contrast Minimum](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum) Success Criterion.
4. [**Reduced Motion**](demos/reduced-motion.html)
   - Support reduced motion when a user has enabled reduced motion, or disabled animations on their operating system, also supporting WCAG's [2.3.3: Animation from Interactions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html) Success Criterion.
